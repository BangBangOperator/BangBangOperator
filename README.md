## 😈 Who Am I?

React beginner. Keyboard abuser. Button clicker.  
Learning how to seduce the DOM while my `useState` ghosts me.

### 🔥 Kinks:
- 🟦 React (my first frontend safe word)
- ⚡ JavaScript (for code that finishes too fast)
- 💔 Git (where I keep making the same mistakes and calling it *version control*)

## 🍑 What This Repo Is

My first React playground.

Expect:
- Buttons that tease but don’t please
- Components that break under pressure
- Console logs like confessions
- Zero testing. Maximum chaos.
